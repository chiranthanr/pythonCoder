# Python programming companion App 🐍
### This is a friendly chat interface built using Mistral's foundational model to help the user with queries on syntax and functions of Python programming language.

#### To use this application, following these steps:

* Clone the Github repository *https://github.com/chiranthanr/pythonCoder.git*
* Install python 3.11 or later in your local system
* Install Ollama in your local computer with instructions in this link - https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/README.md
* Install all required libraries in your environment using '> pip install -r requirements.txt'
* Run Ollama in your local machine with the command '> ollama serve'.If the service is already running then you will 
  be notified accordingly
* Run the pythonCoder application using '> chainlit run app.py'

#### This will now open a chat interface where you can write your python related queries and get instant responses.
